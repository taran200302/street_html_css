        <h1>Street food</h1>
        <p>Street foods are ready-to-eat foods and beverages prepared and/or sold by vendors or hawkers especially in the streets and other similar places.<br> They represent a significant part of urban food consumption for millions of low-and-middle-income consumers, in urban areas on a daily basis. <br>
        But due to covid-19 we cant eat street food so we can make street food at home to fulfil our desires. <br>
